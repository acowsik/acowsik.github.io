This is a personal blog where I write about my hobbies (often in jupyter notebook-y form). I'll try and keep the posts relatively short but link the source notebook as a reference. Feel free to point out bugs or bad ideas on the github repo! 

I currently work at a quantitative trading firm in NYC. I graduated from Princeton University in 2020 where I studied math. I'm interested in climbing, skiing, board games, and machine learning.
